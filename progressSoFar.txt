Project: beyondChatScrape
Progress so far:
- Initialized git repository and connected to GitHub.
- Set up the complete project structure with a Laravel backend, Node.js scripts, and a React frontend.
- Implemented the backend CRUD API for articles.
- Switched the AI rewriting logic from OpenAI to the Google Gemini API.
- Developed the scraper script to find and extract article content from the last page of the blog.
- Developed the rewriter script to use Google Search for references and enrich the AI prompt.
- Created a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the scraping and rewriting tasks.
- Created a comprehensive README.md with local setup instructions and an architecture diagram.
- Deployed the backend to Render and the frontend to Vercel.

Current Problem:
- The live frontend at `https://beyond-chat-scrape.vercel.app/` is unable to fetch data from the live backend at `https://beyondchat-backend-094a.onrender.com`.
- The backend is consistently returning a `500 Internal Server Error`, which indicates a crash in the Laravel application itself.
- The root cause is likely a misconfiguration in the production environment, probably related to the database connection or file permissions on the live server. We are actively diagnosing this.
